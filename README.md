# Rowdy-Quest

This is Tyler's version of the bare-bones application. The files are heavily commented, except the .txt file that defines the map are not; for this file, the first line defines the size, the second line defines the player starting point, and the rest of the file defines the tiles to be used and the structure of the map.
